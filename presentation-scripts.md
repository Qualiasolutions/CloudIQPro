## Script 2: What To Say To The Other Person

### Opening (30 seconds)
"I want to show you a business opportunity we've developed at Qualia Solutions. We've created an AI system called CloudIQ Pro that helps companies save 40% on their cloud costs while preventing server crashes. This is specifically for the Cyprus market where companies are moving to digital transformation."

### The Problem (1 minute)
"Right now, Cyprus companies are wasting massive amounts of money on cloud services. They're spending 40% more than they need to because they don't know how to optimize their servers. Plus, when servers crash, it costs them thousands in downtime. Most IT teams are just reacting to problems instead of preventing them."

### Our Solution (1 minute)
"CloudIQ Pro uses AI to watch all their cloud servers - whether they're on Amazon, Microsoft, or Google Cloud. It predicts problems 15-60 minutes before they happen and automatically optimizes costs. Companies see a 40% reduction in cloud spending and 99.9% uptime."

### The Market (30 seconds)
"The Cyprus cloud market is growing at 20% per year and will be worth over €1 billion by 2030. 93% of Cyprus companies are prioritizing digital transformation right now. We're the first AI company in Cyprus to target this specific problem."

### The Demo (2 minutes)

"This is the actual system running live. You can see:
- Real servers from different cloud providers
- AI alerts warning about issues before they happen
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Performance trends
- Everything updates in real-time"

### The Business Model (1 minute)
"We charge €299-€2,499 per month depending on how many servers they have. Our projections show €500K revenue in year 1, €2M in year 2, and €5M in year 3 as we expand across the Mediterranean. Customers see ROI in 3-6 months through cost savings alone."

### Why Us (30 seconds)
"Qualia Solutions already has 22 AI solutions running across 5 countries. We understand the Cyprus market, EU compliance, and we speak both Greek and English. International competitors are too expensive and don't understand local needs."

### Next Steps (30 seconds)
"We're offering free 30-day pilots to prove the value immediately. Implementation takes 2-4 weeks and we guarantee at least 20% cost reduction. The question is: do you want to be part of capturing this €1 billion market opportunity?"

### Closing
"This presentation shows everything working live. The technology is proven, the market is ready, and we have first-mover advantage in Cyprus. What questions do you have?"
